# odin-recipes
It’s time to practice all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired. In this project, I'll build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time we're finished, unless someone's into brutalist web design, that is.

But it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build my HTML chops; & that I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
